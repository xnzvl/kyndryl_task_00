# kyndryl_task_00

In this repository you will find my solution for the task I received via email.

> Task: https://gitlab.com/interviews26/developers/internship-students

*(me = Jakub Nezval - jakubnezval.jn@gmail.com)* 

## `intern_task.js`

This file contains my whole solution.

I opted for adjacency-list graph representation, because this approach was hinted in the task description.
However, my graph is quite dense, therefore adjacency-matrix would be more optimal representation.

Unfortunately I was unable to implement *Optional extensions* due to lack of time.

### run `intern_task.js`

Run `intern_task.js` using **Node.js**. *(https://nodejs.org/en)*

Example in bash:

```bash
$ node intern_task.js
```

### map

Edges without arrows are bidirectional.
